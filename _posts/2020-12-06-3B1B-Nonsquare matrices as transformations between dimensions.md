<h4>Encoding transformations with a matrix </h4>
=> look at where each basis vector lands, and write the coordinates of the landing spots as the columns of a matrix <br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>geometric interpretation<h3>
<br>
  <h4>3 by 2 matrix  (2 dimensions -> 3 dimensions)</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>2 columns ;  input space has 2 basis vectors</li>
  <li>3 rows ; landing spots have 3 separate coordinates.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <em>full rank</em> the input space dimensions = landing space dimensions
<br>
<br>
<h4>2 by 3 matrix (3 dimensions -> 2 dimensions)</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>3 columns ; input space has 3 basis vectors(3 dimension)</li>
  <li>2 rows ; landing spot for each of those 3 basis</li>
   </ul>
<br>
<br>
<h4>1 by 2 matrix (2 dimensions -> 1 dimension / 2d vectors -> numbers)</h4>
  1 dimension is just a number line
  linearity in this case ;  a line of evenly spaced dots -> remain evenly spaced after the        transformation <ul>
  <li>2 columns that have just a single entry : where the basis vectors land</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  *close ties to the dot product
</ul>
