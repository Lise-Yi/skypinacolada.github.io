3 distinctive but related perspectives about vectors
12
​
13
​
14
1. Physics
15
  : Arrows pointing in space, defined by 
16
    1) length
17
    2) direction 
18
  As long as those 2 facts are the same, you you can move it all around and it's still the same vector. 
19
  Vectors can freely sit anywhere they want in space. 
20

21
​
22
2. Computer Science
23
  : Ordered lists of numbers.
24
  The order matters here. 
25
  If the length of the list is 2, it's two-dimensional.
26
​
27
​
28
3. Mathematics
29
  : Anything where there's a sensible notion of adding 2 vectors, and multiplying a vector by a number
30
  Seeks to generalise both of prior views

At first, we will think about an arrow inside a coordinate system, like the x-y plane, with its tail sitting at the origin.
36
In linear algebra, it's almost always the case that your vector will be rooted at the origin. 
37
Once we understand a new concept in the context of arrows in space, we'll translate it over to the list-of numbers perspective, which we can do by considering the coordinates of the vector.
38

40
The coordinates of a vector is a pair of numbers that give instructions for how to get from the tail of that vector - at the origin- to its tip. 
41
The first number tells you how far to walk along the x-axis, and the second number tells you how far to walk parallel to the y-axis after that. 
42
In three dimensions, you add a third axis, called the z-axis, which is perpendicular to both the x- and y-axes, and in this case each vector is associated with an ordered triplet of numbers.
43
The third one tells you how far to move parallel to this new z-axis.
