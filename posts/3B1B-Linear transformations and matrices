<h2>“Transformation” is a fancy word for “function”</h2>

then why “transformation” instead of “function”?
=> to be suggestive of a way to visualize this input-output relation.
Moving around all of the points in space gives the feeling of squishing and morphing space itself.



<h2>Linear algebra limits itself to “linear” transformations.</h2>

All lines(including diagonal) must remain lines, without getting curved. You should keep them parallel and evenly spaced. 
The origin must remain fixed in place.


<br>
<br>
<h2>how do you describe these transformations numerically?</h2>

you only need to record where the 2 basis vectors, i-hat and j-hat each land.
<h3>entries a,b,c,d.</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>i-hat => (a,c)</li>
    <li>j-hat => (b,d)</li>
  </ul>

<br>
<br>
<h2>When we apply this transformation to some vector (x,y), what do you get?</h2>

((a,c),(b,d))(x,y)
x(a,c) + y(b,d) = (ax+by, cx+dy)
((a,c,),(b,d))(x,y) = x(a,c) + y(b,d) = (ax+by, cx+dy)


<br>
<br>
<h2>shear</h2>
In it, i-hat remains fixed, so the first column of the matrix is (1,0).
but j-hat moves over to the coordinates(1,1).
((1,0)(1,1))


<br>
<br>
<h2>What about the other way around?</h2>

Starting with the matrix and deduce what its transformation looks like

Every time you see a matrix, you can interpret it as a certain transformation of space.
Matrices describe these transformations, and matrix-vector multiplication computes what that transformation does to a given vector.

If the vectors that i-hat and j-hat land on are linearly dependent, the linear transformation squishes all of 2d space onto the line(the 1-dimensional span).
